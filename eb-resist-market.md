<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The EB Resist Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive EB Resists</li><li>Negative EB Resists</li></ul></p>
<p><p>EB Resist Market Types refer to two different types of resist materials used in electron beam lithography. </p><p>Positive EB resist, when exposed to electron beam radiation, becomes more soluble in a developer solution, selectively removing the exposed areas and leaving behind the desired pattern. This type of resist is mainly used in the fabrication of microelectronics and nanotechnology devices. </p><p>On the other hand, negative EB resist becomes less soluble when exposed to electron beam radiation, resulting in the unexposed areas being removed by the developer solution. This type of resist is commonly used in the production of micro-optical elements and integrated circuits.</p></p>
