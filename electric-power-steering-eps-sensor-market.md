<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Power Steering EPS Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Torque Only Sensor(TOS)</li><li>Torque Angle Sensor(TAS)</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Electric Power Steering (EPS) Sensor market comprises two main types: Torque Only Sensor (TOS) and Torque Angle Sensor (TAS). TOS measures the input torque applied by the driver and does not provide information regarding steering angle. On the other hand, TAS measures both torque and steering angle. TOS is simpler and more cost-effective, but it lacks the ability to provide accurate information about the vehicle's steering position. TAS, on the other hand, provides comprehensive data about torque and angle, enabling more precise control and feedback in electric power steering systems.</p></p>
