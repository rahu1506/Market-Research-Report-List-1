<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Water-based Floor Paint Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water-Diluted Paint</li><li>Water Dispersible Paint</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Water-based floor paint is a type of paint that is specifically formulated for application on floors. There are two main types of water-based floor paint: water-diluted paint and water dispersible paint. </p><p>Water-diluted paint refers to a type of floor paint that is mixed with water before application. This helps to reduce the viscosity of the paint, making it easier to spread and apply on the floor surface. Water-diluted paint is commonly used for concrete or wood floors.</p><p>On the other hand, water dispersible paint is a type of floor paint that can be easily mixed with water to achieve the desired consistency. Unlike water-diluted paint, water dispersible paint forms a stable emulsion when mixed with water, allowing for easy application on various floor surfaces, including concrete, wood, or even metal. It offers excellent adhesion properties and is often used in high-traffic areas that require durable and long-lasting floor coatings.</p></p>
