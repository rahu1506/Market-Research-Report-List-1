<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spray Polyurethane Foam for Marine Flotation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>One-Component</li><li>Two-Component</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Spray Polyurethane Foam (SPF) is commonly used in marine flotation applications due to its buoyancy properties. It is available in two market types: one-component and two-component. One-component SPF comes in a ready-to-use format and does not require any additional mixing, making it convenient for smaller projects. On the other hand, two-component SPF requires the mixing of two separate liquids, creating a chemical reaction that expands the foam. This type is commonly used for larger marine flotation projects where greater insulation and structural support are needed.</p></p>
