<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cleanroom Air Filter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>HEPA Filters</li><li>ULPA Filters</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The cleanroom air filter market consists of two dominant types: HEPA (High-Efficiency Particulate Air) filters and ULPA (Ultra-Low Particulate Air) filters. HEPA filters function by capturing particles above a certain size threshold, typically 0.3 microns, offering high filtration efficiency. ULPA filters, on the other hand, provide even higher filtration performance, capturing particles as small as 0.1 microns. Both filters are crucial components in cleanroom environments, where the removal of airborne contaminants is critical for maintaining optimum air quality and preventing contamination in sensitive industries such as healthcare, pharmaceuticals, and electronics manufacturing.</p></p>
