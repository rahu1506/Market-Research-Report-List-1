<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydraulic Starter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gear Hydraulic Starter</li><li>Piston Hydraulic Starter</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Gear Hydraulic Starter: A gear hydraulic starter is a type of hydraulic starter that utilizes a gear mechanism to engage with the engine's flywheel and initiate its rotation. It operates by using hydraulic pressure to transmit power to the gears, which then transmit the power to the engine. Gear hydraulic starters are known for their durability, reliability, and ability to handle heavy-duty engines.</p><p>Piston Hydraulic Starter: A piston hydraulic starter is another type of hydraulic starter that utilizes a piston mechanism to initiate the engine's rotation. It operates by using hydraulic pressure to create a reciprocating motion in the piston, which then transfers the power to the engine. Piston hydraulic starters are preferred for smaller engines due to their compact size, lighter weight, and ease of installation. They are also known for their quick and smooth starting performance.</p></p>
