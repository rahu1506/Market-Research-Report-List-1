<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nickel Plating on Plastic Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Plating</li><li>Electroless Plating</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Nickel plating on plastic refers to the process of depositing a layer of nickel onto a plastic surface. There are two main market types for this process: plating and electroless plating. Plating involves the use of an electric current to adhere a layer of nickel onto the plastic surface, while electroless plating does not require an electric current and instead relies on a chemical reaction to achieve the same result. Both market types offer different advantages and applications, depending on the specific needs and requirements of the plastic product.</p></p>
