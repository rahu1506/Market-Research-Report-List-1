<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rutile TiO2 Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sulfate Process</li><li>Chloride Process</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The rutile TiO2 market consists of two main types: the sulfate process and the chloride process. The sulfate process involves the reaction between titanium ore and sulfuric acid, resulting in the production of rutile TiO2. This method is widely used due to its low production costs. On the other hand, the chloride process involves the reaction between titanium ore and chlorine gas, resulting in the production of high-quality rutile TiO2. However, this method is more expensive and complex compared to the sulfate process. Both processes play a significant role in the rutile TiO2 market.</p></p>
