<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The EPDM Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solution Polymerization</li><li>Suspension Polymerization</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Solution polymerization and suspension polymerization are two market types in the EPDM (ethylene propylene diene monomer) market. In solution polymerization, the process involves dissolving the monomer in a solvent and adding initiators to start the reaction. This method allows for better control over molecular weight and polymer properties. Suspension polymerization, on the other hand, involves dispersing the monomer in water with the help of stabilizers and initiators. This process creates small beads of polymer suspended in the water, which can be processed into various forms.</p></p>
