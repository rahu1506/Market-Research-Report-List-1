<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rodenticide Industry Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Anticoagulants Rodenticides</li><li>Non-anticoagulants Rodenticides</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The rodenticide industry includes two main market types: anticoagulant rodenticides and non-anticoagulant rodenticides. Anticoagulant rodenticides are substances that prevent blood from clotting, leading to internal bleeding and death in rodents. Non-anticoagulant rodenticides, on the other hand, work by disrupting the rodents' nervous system or causing organ failure, resulting in their elimination. Both types of rodenticides are widely used in pest control to eradicate rodent infestations and protect agricultural crops and human environments from damage caused by these pests.</p></p>
