<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Metal Caster Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Swivel Caster</li><li>Rigid Caster</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The industrial metal caster market consists of two main types: swivel casters and rigid casters. Swivel casters are designed to rotate 360 degrees, allowing for easy maneuverability and versatile movement. They are ideal for applications requiring tight turns or directional changes. On the other hand, rigid casters have a fixed direction and do not rotate. They offer stability and straight-line movement, making them suitable for applications where precise control and stability are crucial. These two caster types cater to different industrial needs by providing varying levels of mobility and stability.</p></p>
