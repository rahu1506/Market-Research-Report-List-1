<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Water-Based Fertilizer Colorants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dyes</li><li>Pigments</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Water-based fertilizer colorants are categorized into two types: dyes and pigments.</p><p>Dyes are water-soluble molecules that add color to the fertilizer solution. They are easily dissolved and provide a transparent or translucent color. Dyes are widely used because of their cost-effectiveness and ease of application.</p><p>On the other hand, pigments are insoluble particles that are dispersed in the fertilizer solution. They give a more opaque and intense color to the product. Pigments offer better durability and light stability, making them suitable for long-term coloration of fertilizers. They are commonly preferred for outdoor applications.</p></p>
