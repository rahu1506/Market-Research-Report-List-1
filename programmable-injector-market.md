<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Programmable Injector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Split</li><li>Splitless</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The programmable injector market consists of two main types: split and splitless. In a split configuration, the injector divides the sample into two parts: one for analysis and the other for disposal. This separation allows for better detection sensitivity and prevents sample overload. On the other hand, in a splitless configuration, the entire sample is injected into the analytical column for a higher compound detection limit. Both types offer different advantages depending on the analytical goals and requirements of the user.</p></p>
