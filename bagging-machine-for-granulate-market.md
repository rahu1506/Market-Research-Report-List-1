<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bagging Machine for Granulate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>V-FFS</li><li>H-FFS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bagging machines for granulate market types can be classified into V-FFS (vertical form fill seal) and H-FFS (horizontal form fill seal). V-FFS machines operate by vertically forming a bag from a roll of film, filling it with granulate, and then sealing it. On the other hand, H-FFS machines form a bag horizontally, then fill and seal it. Both types of machines efficiently package granulate products, but the difference lies in their orientation and the way bags are formed and sealed.</p></p>
