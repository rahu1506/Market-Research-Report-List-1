<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Vehicle Exhaust Emission Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>SCR Systems</li><li>EGR Systems</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Commercial Vehicle Exhaust Emission Systems can be categorized into two types: Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) Systems and Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) Systems. SCR systems reduce harmful exhaust emissions by injecting a urea-based reducing agent into the exhaust stream, converting nitrogen oxides (NOx) into harmless nitrogen and water vapor. On the other hand, EGR systems recirculate a portion of exhaust gases back into the engine, reducing the combustion temperature and minimizing the formation of NOx. Both systems play a crucial role in reducing air pollution and meeting emission regulations for commercial vehicles.</p></p>
