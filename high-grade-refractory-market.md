<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High Grade Refractory Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Shaped Refractories</li><li>Unshaped Refractories</li></ul></p>
<p><p>High grade refractory market types include shaped refractories and unshaped refractories. Shaped refractories are pre-formed products designed to fit specific applications, such as bricks, tiles, or blocks. They are manufactured using molds and can provide excellent thermal insulation and resistance to high temperatures. On the other hand, unshaped refractories are monolithic materials that can be applied in a plastic or liquid form. They are often used for quick repairs or in complex shapes where pre-formed products are not suitable. Unshaped refractories offer flexibility and are easy to install.</p></p>
