<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Air Brake System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air Disc</li><li>Air Drum</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive air brake system market consists of two main types: air disc and air drum brakes. Air disc brakes feature a rotor and caliper design, where the caliper clamps the rotor to slow down or stop the vehicle. These brakes offer enhanced performance, durability, and reduced weight. On the other hand, air drum brakes utilize a drum and shoe design, where the shoes expand against the drum to create friction and stop the vehicle. Although they are less advanced than air disc brakes, they are still widely used in commercial and heavy-duty vehicles due to their reliability and cost-effectiveness.</p></p>
