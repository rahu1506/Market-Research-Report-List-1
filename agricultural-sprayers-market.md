<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agricultural Sprayers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ultra-Low Volume</li><li>Low Volume</li><li>High Volume</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Agricultural sprayers are equipment used to apply fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides in order to enhance crop productivity. The market for agricultural sprayers can be classified into three types: ultra-low volume (ULV), low volume (LV), and high volume (HV). ULV sprayers are designed for precise application of chemicals in low quantities, making them ideal for insect control. LV sprayers are more suitable for row and orchard crops, as they deliver a moderate amount of chemicals in a controlled manner. HV sprayers are used for larger areas and high-volume crops, where a large quantity of chemicals needs to be applied uniformly.</p></p>
