<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sodium Percarbonate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>COP</li><li>WPC</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Sodium Percarbonate (SPC) is a chemical compound widely used as a cleaning agent and detergent. In the market, two types of Sodium Percarbonate, namely COP (Coated Sodium Percarbonate) and WPC (Uncoated Sodium Percarbonate), exist. COP is coated with a layer of protective material, enhancing its stability and preventing moisture absorption, making it suitable for long-term storage. On the other hand, WPC lacks the coating, resulting in shorter shelf life but allowing for immediate activation upon contact with water. The choice between COP and WPC depends on the specific requirements and usage of the product.</p></p>
