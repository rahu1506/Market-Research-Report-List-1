<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mold Release Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water Based</li><li>Solvent Based</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Mold release agents are substances used to prevent molds from sticking to surfaces during the manufacturing process. There are two main types of mold release agents: water-based and solvent-based. Water-based mold release agents are made up of water and emulsifiers, offering environmental advantages and easy cleanup. On the other hand, solvent-based mold release agents use solvents like petroleum distillates, propellants, or chlorofluorocarbons to offer quick and efficient release properties. Both types have their own advantages and choosing the right type depends on factors such as application, surface type, and environmental considerations.</p></p>
