<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Magnesium–air Fuel Cells Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rechargeable</li><li>Non-rechargeable</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Magnesium-air fuel cells are energy storage devices that convert chemical energy from the reaction of magnesium with oxygen into electrical energy. They are categorized into two market types: rechargeable and non-rechargeable. Rechargeable fuel cells can be reused by replenishing the magnesium anode, allowing sustained use over time. Non-rechargeable fuel cells, on the other hand, cannot be reused and are discarded after their magnesium anode is consumed. Both market types offer different benefits and applications depending on the required duration of energy supply and the need for sustainability.</p></p>
