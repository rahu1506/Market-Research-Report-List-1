<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hard Rock Shiled Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Shielded Type TBMs</li><li>Open Type TBMs</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Shielded Type TBMs refer to tunnel boring machines that are enclosed within a shield to protect the workers and tunneling process from external factors. These machines are suitable for challenging geologies and urban areas. On the other hand, Open Type TBMs operate without a shield, requiring direct contact between workers and the tunnel face. This type is used when the ground conditions are stable and there is no need for additional protection. Both Shielded and Open Type TBMs cater to different market segments based on the specific geological and functional requirements of the tunneling project.</p></p>
