<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Conical Mechanical Seals Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pusher Type Seal</li><li>Non-pusher Seal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Conical mechanical seals are divided into two primary market types: pusher type seals and non-pusher seals. Pusher type seals utilize springs to maintain contact between the seal face and the rotating shaft, ensuring effective sealing. On the other hand, non-pusher seals rely on the pressure of the process fluid to maintain contact and provide sealing. Both types have their own advantages and are used in various applications, depending on factors such as pressure, temperature, and the nature of the fluid being sealed.</p></p>
